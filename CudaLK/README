(Benjamin Lefaudeux - contains code from Nghia Ho - 2012)
Library implementing standard Lucas & Kanade tracking in its pyramidal form (see Jean-Yves Bouguet). 
The code uses CUDA, which offloads calculus onto the GPU. No guarantee, there may still be some bugs..

Two possible trackings : run() and run4Frames()
- run4Frames keeps stereo pairs in a back buffer, and performs redundant tracking. 
loadbackpictures() must be called once initially for the first two pictures, 
then loadcurrentpictures() must be called for every new stereo pair

- run just tracks points from a picture to another. serveral options are possible,
to specify window size, max iteration number, etc..
